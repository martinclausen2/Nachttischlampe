/* Functions to play sound
 * storage for sound: plain 8 bit data stored in external data flash connected to spi port
 *    => do no access flash and lcd simultaniously!
 * /cs of flash and shutdown of amplifier can share the same control line
 * internal DAC is used as an output
 * DAC output should be filtered
 * address lines for volume are shared with the get_brightness functions
 *    => disable brightness mesurement during play back and restore settings afterwards
 *
 * Functions:
 * setup menu, accessable during start up
 * external flash chip erase followed by 
 * loading external data flash on spi port with data from uart
